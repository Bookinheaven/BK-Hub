                Throughout history, the Panther Tribe has safeguarded Wakanda from external and internal threats.
                Honoring the spirits of past rulers, each new Black Panther is guided by their wisdom.
                Every leader must prove themselves worthy, facing trials in the sacred heart of Wakanda.

                From the moment the first Panther ascended, the tribe was entrusted with Wakanda’s future.
                Legends speak of Bashenga, the first to consume the Heart-Shaped Herb, gaining divine strength.
                Aided by his people, he united the tribes and became Wakanda’s first true king.
                Guardianship of the Vibranium Mound fell to the Panther Clan, ensuring its secrets remained safe.

                In time, Bashenga’s descendants continued his path, ruling with wisdom and might.
                Sacred rituals preserved the connection between rulers and the Panther God, Bast.

                Carrying the mantle of Black Panther meant embracing duty, honor, and responsibility.
                Tales of past leaders were told under the night sky, inspiring future generations.
                For Wakandans, their ancestry was more than history—it was a sacred bond.

                heroic sacrifices shaped the kingdom, ensuring its continued prosperity.
                empires rose and fell, yet Wakanda endured, untouched by colonial conquest.

                Determination defined their lineage, each leader upholding the great legacy.

                How the world saw Wakanda mattered little; its strength was in its people.
                Empowered by Vibranium, warriors trained in the art of combat from birth.
                Rulers led not just with power but with wisdom passed down through the ages.
                Balance between tradition and modernity defined Wakanda’s unique evolution.
