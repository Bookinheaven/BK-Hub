Compile the Verilog Files:
Save the Verilog files: Save your Verilog design file (e.g., four_bit_adder.v) and the testbench file (e.g., testbench.v) in a directory.

Compilation: Open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Verilog files, and compile them using iverilog:

iverilog -o simulation_tb four_bit_adder.v testbench.v
Replace four_bit_adder.v and testbench.v with your actual Verilog file names.

Simulation Execution:
Run Simulation: Run the simulation using vvp (Verilog VPI) on the compiled output file:

vvp simulation_tb
Replace simulation_tb with the name provided using -o in the compilation step.

View Simulation Output: The simulation output will be displayed in the terminal if you've included display statements ($display) in your testbench code.

Waveform Viewing (Optional):
View Waveforms: If your testbench includes $dumpfile and $dumpvars commands, it generates a VCD file with waveform data. Open the generated VCD file in GTKWave for waveform viewing:

gtkwave waveform_output.vcd
Replace waveform_output.vcd with the name of your VCD file.

Notes:
Adjust the file names and paths according to your project structure.
Ensure your testbench has $dumpfile and $dumpvars commands to generate the waveform output file if you intend to view waveforms.
Check the terminal for any simulation output or errors after running each command.
